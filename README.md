## Features
### This app allows moving the *Back* action from the top-left in a Stream Deck Folder

## Disclaimer
This may damage your profiles! Use with caution and under your own risk. **Make a backup by EXPORTING the profile before running this app!**

## Usage
1. Backup your existing profile (just in case)
2. Run the app and choose the right profile
3. Select which folder you would like to change (based on its location on the Stream Deck)
4. Select where you would like the new back button to exist. 
Note: If there is already a key in that location, that key will move to the top-left position instead of the back key.
5. If said it's successful, completely shut down the Stream Deck app and restart it to see the change.
